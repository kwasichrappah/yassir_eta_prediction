# Yassir ETA PredictionMachine Learning Predictor Project


## Overview
Yassir is an Algerian company in the competitive ride hailing marketing. The company wants a competitive edge against its competitors has decided to have an improved ETA for its company. Using ML tools to improve ETA based on the ride distance,pickup and dropoff locations and weather conditions such as wind speed,precipitation levels,temperature and pressure.

## Donor of database: 
                          The Yassir Ride Hailing Company
                         

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning models and finally a webapp that can closely predict the ETA of riders to help in their daily planning.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains confidential information about customer usage in November and December and includes features such as:
- ID 
- Pickup Location
- Dropoff Location
- Trip distance

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset files.
- **yassir_eta_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.`
- **models/**: Saved machine learning tuned models.
- **frontend/**: Web interface for prediction.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

   #git clone https://github.com/kwasichrappah/yassir_eta_prediction

   cd yassir_eta_prediction
2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Docker container for the web interface and the api

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit


## Data analysis 
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis 
- Analytical questions 

## Models
- Logistic Regression
- SVR 
- XGBoost
- LGBM


## Model Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the machine learning models using metrics such as MAE and RMSE. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques are used to optimize model performance.

## Deployment
The trained machine learning model can be deployed using the scripts provided.
